## User Story

As a user, I want to open the page and either type in a name, search through a genre, or search through a platform, so that I may locate a specific game, a youtube video of that game, and aspects and ratings of said game. Additionaly, I'd like to click on the gif under the search query, be taken to a page where I can test my video game knowledge, and enter my highscore once the test is finished, so that my friends may see how knowledgeable I am in video games.
